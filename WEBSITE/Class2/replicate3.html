        <b>The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus)</b>sd, sometimes referred to
        as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal endemic
        to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is the sole
        living representative or monotypic taxon of its family
        (Ornithorhynchidae)[4] and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number of
        related species appear in the fossil record.

      <h2>Taxonomy and etymology</h2>

      <p style="background-color: rgb(0, 128, 98); color: aliceblue">
        When the platypus was first encountered by Europeans in 1798, a pelt and
        sketch were sent back to Great Britain by Captain John Hunter, the
        second Governor of New South Wales.[6] British scientists' initial hunch
        was that the attributes were a hoax.[7]
        <span style="color: red">George Shaw</span>, who produced the first
        description of the animal in the Naturalist's Miscellany in 1799, stated
        it was impossible not to entertain doubts as to its genuine nature,[8]
        and Robert Knox believed it might have been produced by some Asian
        taxidermist.[7] It was thought that somebody had sewn a duck's beak onto
        the body of a beaver-like animal. Shaw even took a pair of scissors to
        the dried skin to check for stitches.[9][8]

      <h3>Electrolocation</h3>

        <u
          >Monotremes are the only mammals (apart from at least one species of
          dolphin)[38] known to have a sense of electroreception: they locate
          their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by muscular
          contractions. The platypus's electroreception is the most sensitive of
          any monotreme.</u

      <h3>Venom</h3>
      <p style="color: aqua">
        <s
          >While both male and female platypuses are born with ankle spurs, only
          the spurs on the male's back ankles deliver venom,[30][31][32]
          composed largely of defensin-like proteins (DLPs), three of which are
          unique to the platypus.[33]</s
