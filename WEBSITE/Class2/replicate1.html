        <b>The alpaca (Lama pacos) </b>is a species of South American camelid
        mammal. It is similar to, and often confused with, the llama. However,
        alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals are
        closely related and can successfully crossbreed. Both species are
        believed to have been domesticated from their wild relatives, the vicu√±a
        and guanaco. There are two breeds of alpaca: the <i>Suri alpaca</i> and
        the <i>Huacaya alpaca</i>.

        Huacaya alpacas are the most commonly found, constituting about 90% of
        the population.[10] The Huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in
        post-colonial Peru. This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them
        more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being
        pushed into the highlands of Peru with the arrival of the
        Spanish.[11][better source needed]

        Alpaca fleece is soft and possesses water and flame resistant
        properties, making it a valuable commodity.[41] Alpacas are typically
        sheared once per year in the spring. Each shearing produces
        approximately 2.3 to 4.5 kilograms (5 to 10 pounds) of fiber per alpaca.
        An adult alpaca might produce 1.4 to 2.6 kilograms (50 to 90 ounces) of
        first-quality fiber as well as 1.4 to 2.8 kilograms (50 to 100 ounces)
        of second- and third-quality fiber. The quality of alpaca fiber is
        determined by how crimpy it is. Typically, the greater the number of
        small folds in the fiber, the greater the quality.
