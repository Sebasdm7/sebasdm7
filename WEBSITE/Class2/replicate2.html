      <p>
        <b>The kangaroo</b> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
        (macropods, meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used to
        describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well
        as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey
        kangaroo.[1] Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea. The
        Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within
        the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2
        million in 2013.[2]

      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p>
        The word kangaroo derives from the <i>Guugu Yimithirr word gangurru</i>,
        referring to eastern grey kangaroos.[12][13] The name was first recorded
        as "kanguru" on 12 July 1770 in an entry in the diary of Sir Joseph
        Banks; this occurred at the site of modern Cooktown, on the banks of the
        Endeavour River, where HMS Endeavour under the command of Lieutenant
        James Cook was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained
        on the Great Barrier Reef.[14] Cook first referred to kangaroos in his
        diary entry of 4 August. Guugu Yimithirr is the language of the people
        of the area.

        The antilopine kangaroo (Osphranter antilopinus)[22] is, essentially,
        the far northern equivalent of the eastern grey and western grey
        kangaroos. It is sometimes referred to as the antilopine wallaroo, but
        in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to the red, eastern grey and
        western grey kangaroos.
